# Choose and learn your editor(s)


Computing's interface is text. To work effectively, you need to be fluent with this interface.


### Typing

It may sound silly, but [make sure](http://www.typingtest.com/) you know how to type. You should be comfortable typing with perfect accuracy at 60 words per minute, at least. If you currently can't, practice until you can.

A lot of your work will be done in a text editor. You have to know how to use your editor. Any editor will work, but knowing a powerful editor well will make you faster, more comfortable, and more effective.


### Terminal Editor

Sometimes you will need to use a non-graphical text editor. This means an editor that will run entirely inside a terminal window, without spawning a new window, entirely without mouse input.

Make sure that you know at least one of these well enough to do basic editing in a terminal:

 * Emacs
 * vim
 * nano

You should know at least enough vim to be able to get out of it, because it is the default on many systems and you might find yourself in it even if you didn't mean to be.

If you intend to use a graphical editor that doesn't run in a terminal, nano might be a good choice for you because it is very simple.

Both Emacs and vim have built-in interactive tutorials that you can try.

What terminal editor will you use? How did you make your decision?

>>I will be using vim. After doing a bit of research, it seems like both Emacs and vim have their pros and cons. What specifically caught my attention was how vim has standard commands whereas Emacs provides a more tailored experience. Since vim is already present on most machines I think it would be beneficial to learn vim first. I also plan on using Sublime as my graphical editor. There is a plugin to use vi in Sublime which could be useful as well.

### Graphical Editor

You will probably spend most of your time with access to a graphical interface, where you have more choices in editors and integrated development environments.

Popular editors and IDEs include:

 * Emacs
 * vim
 * Sublime
 * Atom
 * Spyder
 * PyCharm

If you choose Emacs or vim, you will have essentially the same editor experience across graphical and non-graphical environments, which is nice. It's also nice to be able to work without ever having to use a mouse. Emacs and vim have somewhat steep learning curves, but they give you the ability to customize your environment quite a lot to make it exactly what you want.

Sublime is probably the most popular editor for new coders. You can set it up to integrate with Python fairly well. Atom is pretty similar to Sublime but has an interesting open architecture and is developed by folks at GitHub.

Spyder and PyCharm are IDEs for Python. They try to give you a fully configured setup out of the box.

We will also use Jupyter (IPython) notebooks, but this does not remove the need for proficiency in an editor or IDE.

What graphical editor will you use? How did you make your decision? What are some interesting features of your editor? What are some useful keyboard shortcuts for your editor? How do you customize your editor?

>>I will be using Sublime text. I would like to use a popular editor and it seems like Sublime is a good choice for a number of coding languages. It sits in a middle ground between bare bones editor and full IDE. Sublime is cross platform and has fantastic plug-in support. The features already available include split layouts, navigation through vi commands, code snippets, tabs, and automatic loading of previous sessions. Some plugins which seem useful (aside from Package Control) are Side Bar, SublimeLinter, and GitGutter. Adding plugins and configuring them through JSON is easy to do as well as easily transferable to other instances of Sublime. So far some useful shortcuts are cmd+shift+p for the command palette, ctrl+` for the console, and cmd+b to run code. Additionally, I set up the subl command line tool to open files directly in Sublime from a terminal window.
